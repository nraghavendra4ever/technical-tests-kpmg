# #KPMG TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

This challenge consist of three test as given below:

## [Challenge-1](https://github.com/nraghavendra4ever/technical-tests-kpmg/tree/main/Challenge-1)

A 3 tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

## [Challenge-2](https://github.com/nraghavendra4ever/technical-tests-kpmg/tree/main/Challenge-2)

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

## [Challenge-3](https://github.com/nraghavendra4ever/technical-tests-kpmg/tree/main/Challenge-3)

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.

Example Inputs <br>
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}} <br>
key = a/b/c

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}} <br>
key = x/y/z <br>
value = a
